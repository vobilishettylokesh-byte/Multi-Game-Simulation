This project is a Java-based console gaming system called GamingHub, designed as a central platform where a user can play multiple mini-games from a single menu-driven interface. It demonstrates how different games can be integrated into one application using structured programming and object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and modular design 
At the start, the system creates a Player profile with a username, a randomly generated unique ID, and an initial score of zero. The GamingHub acts as the main controller, displaying a menu that allows the user to choose from several games including Snakes and Ladders, Cricket, CrackIt (password guessing), Hangman, Rock Paper Scissors, and Tic Tac Toe. Each game is implemented as a separate class with its own play() method, making the code modular and easy to extend 
A common scoring system is maintained across all games: whenever the player wins a game, 10 points are added to their total score. The hub continuously runs until the user chooses to exit, after which the player’s details (name, ID, and final score) are saved to a file (playerdata.txt) using file handling concepts, ensuring persistence of data beyond program execution 
Overall, this project showcases a multi-game simulation system that combines user interaction, randomness, game logic, file handling, and OOP principles into a single cohesive application. It is a strong example of how a centralized application can manage multiple independent modules while sharing common data like player information and score.
